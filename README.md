# Kuote

Kuote (as in Kotlin-Quote) is a simple way to share and discover content worth reading. 

We live in an era of unprecedented flow of information. So much, in fact, that great content remains buried under "breaking" news with  bombastic titles, flashy Medium articles, and videos of cute kittens. Explicit banner ads have morphed into the content itself, turning articles, even interesting and informative ones, into sales pitches in disguise. 

Kuote tries to promote great content, by letting readers hunt for the valuable knowledge in articles, and share it with others in the form of Tweet-sized quotes (kuotes). The idea is not new. In fact, Kuote draws inspiration from [QUOTE.fm](https://web.archive.org/web/20130304114648/http://quote.fm:80/welcome) - a platform built by a few guys from Hamburg, Germany, which became popular in the early 2010s, but unfortunately no longer exists.
